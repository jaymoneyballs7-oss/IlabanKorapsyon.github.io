            <h2>What is Corruption?</h2>

            <p>Corruption is the abuse of power for personal gain within a group or structure with people in charge of others. It happens when someone in a position of authority or responsibility uses their role to benefit themselves, their friends, or their associates instead of doing what is morally right or fair. Corruption weakens trust and creates an unfair environment for those affected and is an L play.</p>

            <h3>Examples of Corruption:</h3>

            <p><strong>1. In Schools 学校における汚職 (Gakkō ni okeru oshoku):</strong> In schools, corruption takes on more of an emotional role, such as teachers or staff giving special treatment to certain students, friends copying off of each other during tests or forms of corruption within a class’s structure which lead to bullying of others.
            </p>
            <img class="example-image" src="CorruptionSchool.png" alt="School Example">

            <p><strong>2. In Workplaces 職場における汚職 (Shokuba ni okeru oshoku):</strong> In workplaces, unfair hiring practices happen such as nepotism, hiring or promoting friends or relatives even if they are less qualified, bribery such as employees or managers receiving money in order to give unfair advantages to those under them, and the theft of resources meant for the workplace carries a significant risk in termination of employment and losing aura.
            </p>
            <img class="example-image" src="CorruptionWorkplace.jpeg" alt="Workplace Example">

            <p><strong>3. In Government 政府における汚職 (Seifu ni okeru oshoku):</strong> In the Government, corruption takes on a more significant role that could affect how a country runs itself, so it’s important to identify these situations such as embezzlement where public officials take funds meant for government or public use and services, Bribery also takes place where officials could accept bribes in exchange for permits, approvals, and contracts, often times given by large companies to turn a profit through destructive ways that wouldn't be approved normally due to low rizz with the public, and sometimes corruption affects the decision making process where, individuals and their group could often benefit from. Which leads to unfair decisions being made through connections.

                   <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> A study conducted by the United Nations Development Program estimated that the government lost ₱25 billion due to official corruption.  
                (<a href="https://www.ombudsman.gov.ph/docs/publication/8-Point-Strategy-Primer.pdf" target="_blank">Page 2</a>)  
                This is a result of the greed inherent in the nature of corruption.</p>

                <p>Corruption is not only greedy but also damaging and wasteful. It does nothing to serve the good of a community. To fight this evil, one must strive to be an advocate against it and uphold honor and integrity within their community.</p>

                <p>Even the smallest community can be poisoned by corruption. This abuse hurts not just individuals, but entire neighborhoods, including farmers, fishermen, and livestock keepers—people whose livelihoods depend on natural resources and fair systems of support. Corruption in local governance can divert aid away from those who need it most.  

                For example, a barangay official taking advantage of distributing cash aid demonstrates how even local communities can be riddled with corrupt individuals.  
                (<a href="https://dilg.gov.ph/news/DILG-183-brgy-execs-under-investigation-by-PNP-for-alleged-corruption-in-distributing-cash-aid/NC-2020-1145" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>

                <p>Statistics show that the Philippines ranks 114th out of 180 countries as of 2024, highlighting how leaders continue to fail in stopping corruption within society.  
                (<a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/countries/philippines" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>

                <p>Corruption is not just a political or economic problem—it is a moral and social crisis. It affects even the largest bodies of authority and governance. A troubling trend in recent news shows how corruption has run deep within the Philippine government, particularly impacting funds meant for disaster relief. Unfortunately, some officials exploit natural disasters, embezzling funds for projects that should reduce destruction.</p>

                <p>In July 2025, President Marcos reported that his administration had implemented over 5,500 flood control projects and announced plans for at least ten large-scale projects amounting to more than ₱500 billion (US$10.15 billion) over the next 13 years.  
                (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_control_projects_scandal_in_the_Philippines" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>

                <p>However, in just three towns within Bulacan, the Commission on Audit (COA) found irregularities in four flood control projects worth ₱334 million. In its seventh fraud audit report submitted to the Independent Commission for Infrastructure, COA found evidence of fraud and falsification in all four projects, implicating both public works officials and contractors.  
                (<a href="https://www.rappler.com/philippines/luzon/coa-fraud-audit-defective-flood-control-projects-bulacan-november-12-2025/" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>

                <p>The sheer scale of funds stolen from these projects is alarming. It is a call to action not just for the youth but also for adults with power and influence. Advocacy against corruption should extend beyond small communities and aim towards systemic change at higher levels of authority.</p>

                <p>Promote honesty, integrity, and charitability. Even small actions can make a difference, and these efforts can snowball into larger, more significant impacts for our society.</p>
